# Predictive-Analytics-and-Classification-of-Metal-Part-Lifespan-Using-ML
This project involves analyzing and modeling the Dataset to predict and classify the lifespan of parts based on their manufacturing parameters. It features comprehensive data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and feature engineering, including interaction terms and polynomial features. The project implements regression models (Linear Regression and Random Forest) to predict lifespan and classification models (Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classifier) to determine whether the lifespan exceeds 1500 hours. Hyperparameter tuning optimizes model performance, and the results are visualized through detailed plots, heatmaps, and comparative charts for easy interpretation.
